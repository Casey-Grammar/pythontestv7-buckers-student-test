#Task 9a Snail Cup
'''
Task 9a Snail Cup (8 marks)

You're refereeing a snail race. Sometimes snails curl up and go to sleep 
during races, which disqualifies them.

We've given you a list called racers, which contains the names of the 
snails in the race.

Write a program to help you keep track of the race. It should ask for 
the name of a racer who's gone to sleep and replace their name in the 
list with 'Disqualified'. If that name isn't in the list, it should leave 
the list unmodified and print a message saying all the racers are still awake.

Here's an example of how your program should look:
=========================
And the line up is: Dash, Speedy, Lighting, Flash, Sonic
Who's gone to sleep? Speedy
Speedy has been disqualified!
Remaining racers: Dash, Disqualified, Lighting, Flash, Sonic
========================= 

Here's another example where an inputted name isn't on the list
=========================
And the line up is: Dash, Speedy, Lighting, Flash, Sonic
Who's gone to sleep? Gogo
All snails still awake.
Remaining racers: Dash, Speedy, Lighting, Flash, Sonic
=========================
