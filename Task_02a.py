Task 2 Marco Polo (4marks)
Part a

Marco! Polo! is a popular game of tag played in a swimming pool.  The player who is 'it' shouts 'Marco!' 
and all other players must reply 'Polo!'

Write a program to play Marco! Polo! with you.  It should read in a line of text, and if the line of text 
is Marco! print out Polo!

Your program should work like this when you say Marco!:
=========================
Text: Marco!
Polo!
========================= 

If you say anything else the program should do nothing:
=========================
Text: Hello
=========================

If you say more than Marco!, the program should do nothing:
=========================
Text: Why is this game called Marco! Polo! anyway?
=========================
