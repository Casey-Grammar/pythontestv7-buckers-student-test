Task 4a King Letter (4marks)

In Commonwealth countries, like Australia and New Zealand, the King send 
you an anniversary letter when you turn 100.

Write a program that ask the user for their age, then prints how many 
years until they get their letter (by taking it from 100).

Here's how it should work:
=========================
How old are you? 15
Years until your letter...
85
========================= 

Here's another example:
=========================
How old are you? 90
Years until your letter...
10
=========================
Your program should still subtract from 100, even if you're older than that:
=========================
How old are you? 111
Years until your letter...
-11
=========================
